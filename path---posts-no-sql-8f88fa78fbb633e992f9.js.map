You should start to see how it can drastically impact your performance when you have to do multiple updates in different location. Let&#39;s imagine we are not talking about the `mother` relationship but rather the `friends` which can also have sub-properties plus they can be spread over different nodes that might not be on the same continent. The complexity of the update would be exponential. The longer the update the least you are sure to request up-to-date data. That&#39;s the reason you gain your read performance because each document includes everything you&#39;d need to know but it comes with a write performance tradeoff.\\n\\n2) Embed only the `id` of your document inside other linked documents (**slow read performance** and **good write performance**). If we continue with our previous example we would have:\\n```json\\n// document Person: Bob\\n{\\n  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;47c24738-abe7-4391-9a1a-84dac6da35de&quot;,\\n  &quot;firstname&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;,\\n  &quot;lastname&quot;: &quot;Henri&quot;,\\n  &quot;mother&quot;: {\\n    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;e415d0e8-919c-4b80-a82e-d0aecc6f4e06&quot;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n// document Person: Clara\\n{\\n  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;e415d0e8-919c-4b80-a82e-d0aecc6f4e06&quot;,\\n  &quot;firstname&quot;: &quot;Clara&quot;,\\n  &quot;lastname&quot;: &quot;Henri&quot;,\\n}</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The update would be much faster because the data would be stored only in one document thus all other linked documents would also be updated if an update is performed on the source document.

Again in a distributed data source context this could be quite an expensive operation to perform.</p>\\n<p>In order to make the best design decision you’d need to know that upfront. For example, Facebook uses NoSQL database to store messages and posts because if they lose some information or if they are not all up-to-date that’s not really important however your critical information that they sell are stored in relation databases where you can ensure data integrity.</p>\\n<h2>Best solutions</h2>\\n<h3>Key/value</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Redis</li>\\n<li>Oracle NoSQL Database</li>\\n<li>Riak-TS</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Document oriented</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>MongoDB</li>\\n<li>CouchDB</li>\\n<li>CouchBase</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Column oriented</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Cassandra</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Graph oriented</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Neo4J</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Search Engines</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>ElasticSearch</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>NoSQL will not replace relational databases but rather they solve problem that relation db are not good at.</p>\\n<p>NoSQL databases should not be used for management software such as ERP or accountability software where data integrity is a must have and not really a tradeoff you can afford.</p>\\n<h3>Aside: NewSQL</h3>\\n<p>A new brand of database system rose: NewSQL.
